  ## About

  I needed a more efficient way to generate README files for projects I was working on. I learned a lot while working on this project. Specifically about NODEJS.

  ## Installation 

You will need to install node.js and npm i. Type "node index.js" in your terminal to run the generator and answer the questions to build your README file.
